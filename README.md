## Installation

### Method 1: Direct Copy

1. Copy the script from `ui_toggle.lua`
2. In Roblox Studio, insert a `LocalScript` into `StarterPlayer > StarterPlayerScripts`
3. Paste the code into the LocalScript
4. Test in-game!

### Method 2: Load from GitHub (Advanced)

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("YOUR_RAW_GITHUB_URL_HERE"))()
```

**Note:** This requires HTTP requests to be enabled in your game settings.

## Configuration

You can customize the toggle button by modifying the `SETTINGS` table at the top of the script:

```lua
local SETTINGS = {
    -- Button Size
    BUTTON_SIZE_PC = UDim2.new(0, 35, 0, 22),
    BUTTON_SIZE_MOBILE = UDim2.new(0, 45, 0, 28),
    BUTTON_POSITION = UDim2.new(0, 10, 0, 10),
    
    -- Animation
    ANIMATION_SPEED = 0.3,
    
    -- Text
    TEXT_VISIBLE = "UI",
    TEXT_HIDDEN = "UI",
    
    -- Colors
    COLOR_VISIBLE = Color3.fromRGB(100, 200, 255),  -- Blue
    COLOR_HIDDEN = Color3.fromRGB(255, 100, 100),   -- Red
    
    -- Features
    ENABLE_DRAGGING = true,
    SAVE_POSITION = true
}
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Click the button** - Toggles all UI elements on/off
2. **Drag the button** - Click and hold to move it around your screen
3. **Hover effect** (PC only) - Button grows slightly when you hover over it

### States

- **Blue Border** - UIs are visible
- **Red Border** - UIs are hidden

## How It Works

1. **Toggle Function**: When clicked, the button saves the state of all ScreenGuis and toggles their visibility
2. **State Restoration**: When toggling back, it restores each UI to its previous state
3. **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects mobile vs PC and adjusts accordingly
4. **Animation System**: Uses TweenService for smooth, professional animations

## Technical Details

## Troubleshooting

### Button doesn't appear

- Make sure the script is in a `LocalScript`
- Check that it's placed in `StarterPlayer > StarterPlayerScripts`
- Verify that the player has loaded properly

### Button doesn't hide some UIs

- Some core Roblox UIs cannot be hidden
- Custom UIs must be in `PlayerGui` to be affected
- Check that the UI is a `ScreenGui` instance

### Dragging doesn't work

- Ensure `ENABLE_DRAGGING` is set to `true` in settings
- Make sure the button's parent frame has `Active` set to true

## Customization Examples

### Change Button Position (Top Right)

```lua
BUTTON_POSITION = UDim2.new(1, -50, 0, 10)
```

### Make Button Larger

```lua
BUTTON_SIZE_PC = UDim2.new(0, 60, 0, 40)
BUTTON_SIZE_MOBILE = UDim2.new(0, 70, 0, 50)
```

### Change Colors (Purple Theme)

```lua
COLOR_VISIBLE = Color3.fromRGB(138, 43, 226)
COLOR_HIDDEN = Color3.fromRGB(255, 20, 147)
```

### Disable Dragging

```lua
ENABLE_DRAGGING = false
```

## Performance

- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage
- **Optimized**: Uses efficient state management
- **Clean**: Proper garbage collection and cleanup
